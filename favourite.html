		<p>There's no doubt croton is one of the most popular houseplants because it's so colorful! Featuring leaves dramatically shaded in golden, orange, red, and purple hues, it's perfect for making any indoor space feel like you're deep in a tropical rainforest.
		Despite its bold appearance, croton is easy to grow, especially in a warm, humid environment (though it takes average household or office conditions with ease).<p>
